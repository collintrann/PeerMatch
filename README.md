# PeerMatch
PeerMatch matches students from underrepresented groups in tech with a mentor to help them build projects and navigate the tech recruitment process. Offers students with industry experience mentorship opportunities while partnering with companies committed to diversity and inclusion to offer mentors special internship opportunities.

Many first-generation and low-income students struggle to break into the tech industry for lack of mentorship on how the recruitment process works. PeerMatch helps to increase accessibility into the industry by providing students with peer mentors that have already gone through the same process. These mentors can range from students that attend the same university, or someone going to school across the country, but has similar interests and background.

Partnerships with tech companies offer successful mentors exclusive internship opportunities that incentivize high quality mentorship and help mentors advance their own careers.
